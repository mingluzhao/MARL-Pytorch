- use one hot for soft max for policy? this code uses one hot but original code used softmax (fixed to softmax for run3 but result same)
- removed batch norm (fixed for run4 but result bad)
- layer size (fixed for run 5)
- noise without epsilon (run 6)
- critic target input is the **noisy** target next action? (to do)
